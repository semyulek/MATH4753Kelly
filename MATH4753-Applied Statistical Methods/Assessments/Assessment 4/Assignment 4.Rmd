116 bird species, measured were body mass(g), egg length(mm)

## a.

```{r}
nzbird=read.csv("NZBIRDS.csv")
head(nzbird)
set.seed(50)
sam=nzbird[sample(1:nrow(nzbird),size = 35),]
```

## b.

Body mass

```{r}
mean(sam$Body.Mass)
sd(sam$Body.Mass)
t.test(x = nzbird$Body.Mass,conf.level = .95,mu = 6680.371)$conf.int
```

## c.

We accept our null hypothesis that the mean of our sample, 6680.371g, is in the confidence interval of (3208.217, 13397.434), since 6680.371 is in this interval.

## d.

The true mean of 9113g is in the interval (3208.217, 13397.434). The confidence level we have chosen is alpha=.05, or 95% confidence, and since 95% covers most of the data set, we can be fairly certain that the true mean lies in the interval.

## e.

Egg length

```{r}
mean(sam$Egg.Length,na.rm = T)
sd(sam$Egg.Length,na.rm = T)
t.test(x = nzbird$Egg.Length,conf.level = .95,mu = 55.5303)$conf.int
```

We accept the null hypothesis that 55.5303 is in the interval (53.02102, 68.28667).
61.06 is also in our interval, and since we cover 95% of the data we can be fairly certain that the true mean lies n the interval.

## f.

```{r}
flight_extinct=21/38
flight_alive=7/78
z=qnorm(1-.05/2)
np=38*flight_extinct
np>=4
nq=38*(1-flight_extinct)
nq>=4
np2=78*flight_alive
np2>=4
nq2=78*(1-flight_alive)
nq2>=4
```

Since our approximations are greater than or equal to 4, than we can use CLT.

```{r}
mp=c(-1,1)
(flight_extinct-flight_alive)+mp*z*sqrt((flight_extinct*(1-flight_extinct))/38+(flight_alive*(1-flight_alive))/78)
```

Our 95% ci is (0.2925475, 0.6332285).

## g.

Yes, we 95% confident that 21/38=.5526 lies in the interval while 7/78=.0897 does not, so the proportion of extinct birds is higher.
